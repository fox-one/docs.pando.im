To ensure asset protection, follow the security instructions carefully and guard your private key and password.


## I. Integrating a MetaMask wallet with an MVM network



### Approach One

   Network name: Mixin Virtual Machine

   Network URL: https://geth.mvm.dev 

   Chain ID: 73927

   Block Browser: https://scan.mvm.dev/



After that, the MetaMask plug-in window's top allows you to view and switch networks.

## II. Using other networks to send token/coin to the MVM network



It is crucial to make clear that in the following two steps, cross-link bridge is used, not address transfer, to send data to the MVM network via MetaMask.

1. Launch the [Assets Bridge](https://mvg.finance/) and link the MetaMask wallet.

## III. Using 4swap.org to connect MetaMask wallet for trading


The aforementioned two procedures have stored the digital assets on the MVM chain and have made it simple to trade them through 4swap as follows.



1. Use 4swap.org to connect to the MetaMask wallet.
