Now that you already have the Metamask wallet installed and are familiar with its basic functionalities.

Visit [MetaMask Support](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) to view instructions.

To ensure asset protection, follow the security instructions carefully and guard your private key and password.

## I. Integrating a MetaMask wallet with an MVM network

### Approach One

1. Go to MetaMask and keep your session active.

   - Network name: Mixin Virtual Machine
   - Network URL: https://geth.mvm.dev
   - Chain ID: 73927
   - Currency symbol: ETH
   - Block Browser: https://scan.mvm.dev/

After that, the MetaMask plug-in window's top allows you to view and switch networks.

## II. Using other networks to send token/coin to the MVM network

It is crucial to make clear that in the following two steps, cross-link bridge is used, not address transfer, to send data to the MVM network via MetaMask.

1. Launch the [Assets Bridge](https://mvg.finance/) and link the MetaMask wallet.

## III. Using 4swap.org to connect MetaMask wallet for trading

The aforementioned two procedures have stored the digital assets on the MVM chain and have made it simple to trade them through 4swap as follows.

1. Use 4swap.org to connect to the MetaMask wallet.
