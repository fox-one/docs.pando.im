If combining with other Pando products, you can even have a potential of earning sizable yields. For example, currently you can now supply pUSD in [Pando Rings](https://rings.pando.im/#/) and enjoy the APY for supplying pUSD at around 15.6% while borrowing pUSD from Pando Leaf at only 1% - 1.5%. As you can see, the loan grows at a lower rate than the principal."},{"id":"/2022/05/31/recent development","metadata":{"permalink":"/de/blog/2022/05/31/recent development","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-31-recent development.md","title":"Recent updates on Pando","description":"source","date":"2022-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"31.

When you encounter code that modifies the formatting during translation, leave it unchanged. For example: \\n\\n`You have to keep your collateralization ratio in a safe range\uff08above 150%\uff09 to avoid <strong x-id=\\"1\\">[liquidation]</strong> (https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/key-concepts/liquidation).`\\n\\nThe above is the original text, translated into Korean as follows:\\n\\n`\uccad\uc0b0\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2f4\ubcf4 \ube44\uc728 \uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubc94\uc704( 150% \uc774\uc0c1) \ub85c <strong x-id=\\"1\\"[>\uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.]</strong>(https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/key-concepts/liquidation).`\\n\\n**Q: Translation contains 1 extra symbol\\"(\\"**\\n\\nA: This error usually occurs when Chinese brackets are used, just click Save Anyway.\\n\\n**Q:what\'s the differences between translators and proofreaders?**\\n\\nA: Proofreaders need to review the text saved by other translators. All text should be reviewed and approved by the proofreaders before they are merging to the source code. So the proofreaders will receive more rewards than regular translators. Of course, proofreaders are translator. they can also do the translation.\\n\\n### Honors and Awards\\n\\nFor all translators, we will give:\\n1. The NFT of Pando Translator;\\n2.
